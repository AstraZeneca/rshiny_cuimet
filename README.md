CUI-MET: Clinical Utility Index Dose Optimization Approach for Multiple-Dose, Multiple-Outcome Randomized Trial Designs

CUI-MET is an interactive R Shiny application designed to support dose optimization in early-phase clinical trials. It integrates multiple binary endpoints into a single utility score using user-defined weights. The app allows users to apply various modeling approaches, visualize doseâ€“response trends, and assess the robustness of dose selection using bootstrap resampling.
